# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

## Objective

1. Tune the hyperparameters of PID and implementing the PID on a car simulator.
2. To tune the hyperparameters, implementation of Twiddle alogorithm

## Methodology

Cross Track Error (CTE) is the car's deviation from the centre line of the concerned lane. This CTE acts as the basis of PID controller. CTE directly gives the proportional error 'P'. Differential error 'D' is calculated via measuring the difference between the previous and current CTE. D acts as a damping factor and acts swiftly. To smoothen this transition integral error 'I' is added. I is the sum of all the differental errors over the time. It helps in gazing the damping rate and corrects the fall. 
For the current project, hyperparameters are tuned using twiddle algorithm.

## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1(mac, linux), 3.81(Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).
